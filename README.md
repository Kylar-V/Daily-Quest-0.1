# Daily Quest

Complete quests to earn XP, level up, and grow your character (Warrior, Mage, Ranger, or Rogue).

## ✨ Features
- Add, edit, delete quests (sizes: small/medium/large; types: knowledge/physical/focus/general)
- Single or batch completion with XP, batch bonus, and class-based bonuses
- Leveling with a 10% per-level XP curve (cap 100)
- Filters (status/size/type) + hide completed toggle
- Per-class progress (switch classes without losing progress)
- Persistent save (CLI: `save.json`)
